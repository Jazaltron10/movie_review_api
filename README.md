# **Movie Review API**

## **Project Overview**
The **Movie Review API** allows users to create, read, update, and delete movie reviews. Users can also view reviews by movie and search/filter reviews by rating. The API is built using Django and Django REST Framework, providing a secure, RESTful API that interacts with a database to store user-generated reviews.

## **Features**
- **User Authentication**: Users can register, log in, and manage their profiles.
- **Review Management**: Authenticated users can create, update, and delete reviews.
- **Movie Reviews**: Users can view reviews for a specific movie.
- **Search and Filter**: Search for reviews by movie title or filter by rating.
- **Pagination**: Supports pagination for large datasets of reviews.

## **Technologies Used**
- **Python 3.x**: Main programming language.
- **Django**: Web framework for handling backend logic.
- **Django REST Framework (DRF)**: Framework for building RESTful APIs.
- **PostgreSQL/SQLite**: Database for storing user and review data.
- **JWT Authentication (Optional)**: Token-based authentication for securing API endpoints.
- **Heroku/PythonAnywhere**: For deployment.
